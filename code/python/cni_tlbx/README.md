# Computational Neuroimaging Toolbox

The Computational Neuroimaging Toolbox contains tools for estimating input-referred models. Specifically, it includes tools for Fourier analyses of phase-encoded stimuli, population receptive field (pRF) mapping, fast (real-time) pRF mapping and for estimating parameters of generic (user-defined) input-referred models.
