    % rm = RM() creates an instance of the recurrent model of perceptual
    % learning in early visual cortex using standard parameter values
    % see: Lange G, Senden M, Radermacher A, De Weerd P.
    % Interference  with highly trained skills reveals  competition
    % rather than consolidation (submitted).
    %
    % Use rm.set_OD(x) to set orientation difference to value 'x'; if no value
    %     is provided, OD will be reset to its baseline state (7.5 unless
    %     specified otherwise during construction)
    % Use rm.set_PHI(x) to set reference orientation to value 'x'; if no value
    %     is provided, PHI wil be reset to ts baseline state (135Â° unless
    %     specified otherwise during construction)
    % Use rm.fix(P) to fix a proportion 'P' of connection weights.
    % Use rm.get_JND() to read out the current JND
    % Use rm.session() to simulate a single session of staircase experiment.
    % Use rm.reset() to restore the model to its naive state.
